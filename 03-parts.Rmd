# Imputing Missing Data

Before finally moving onto training and building our predictive model, I want to do something about our missing data:

```{r}
colSums(is.na(modelData))
colSums(is.na(testData))
```

In both `modelData` and `testData`, passenger age seems to be missing the most.  However, we didn't find any significant relationships between one's age and the other variables in our data.
